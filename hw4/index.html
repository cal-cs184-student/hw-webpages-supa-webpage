					When the ks of the springs is low, the springs have very low resistance to stretching. As such the clotch will become very loose and drapey. If we compare the default parameter where the ks is 
					5000 N/m and the low ks is only 100 N/m, we see that the cloth of the low ks sags way more than the default. Also during the simulation process, the cloth of the low ks develops much more wrinkles.
					As for the high ks of 100000 N/m, the springs become more stiff leading to a very regid cloth. We can see this when comparing it to the low ks and default ks where the rest state has minimal wrinkles and
					sagging. When looking at the simulation process, we see that the cloth seems relatively flat.

					A high or low density will affect the mass of each point mass. A high density means that the point masses will be heavier while a low density will mean that the point masses will be lighter. When comparing both the low density (1 g/cm^2)
					and the default we see that the low density is much less saggy and drapey throughout the entire simulation. This is because the point masses are much lighter leading weaker forces acting on them. When looking at the high density (100 g/cm^2), we see that
					the cloth is much more saggy and drapey. This is because the point masses are much heavier leading to stronger forces acting on them. We can see this when comparing the rest state of the default and high density where the high density has a lot more wrinkles, especially in the top 
					middle of the cloth.

					damping is the amount of energy lost in the system from timestep to timestep. A low damping means that the system will lose very little energy and will take a long time to come to rest. When looking at the low damping(0) simulation above, There are definitely more ripples than that of the default. Also since with 0, there is no energy lost and will take an extremely long time 
					to reach a rest state compared to the default. As for the high damping (0.8), we see that it looks very similar to the default. There is more energy lost in the system leading to less ripples during the simulation and reaching a stable rest state.

					gravity on the point masses will affect the amount of force acting on each point mass and the cloth overall. For a low gravity of (-1.5 m/s^2), comparing to the default of -9.8 m/s^2, we see that it is less drapey and saggy.
					This is because with less gravity, the amount of force pointing downwards is less. For the high gravity of (-20 m/s^2), we see that the cloth is much more drapey and saggy. This is because with more gravity, the amount of force pointing downwards is more. We can see this when comparing the rest state of the default and high gravity where the high gravity has a lot more wrinkles, especially in the top middle of the cloth.

		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
		<ol>
			<li> 
				Describe your implementation of handling collisions with spheres and planes.
				<br>
				<br>
				Sphere:
				<br>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Detection: We calculate the vector from the sphereâ€™s center to the point massâ€™s current position. If the norm of this vector is less than the sphereâ€™s radius, it means the point mass is either intersecting or completely inside the sphere.
					</li>
					<li>
						Computing the Tangent Point: When a collision is detected, we calculate the position where the point mass should be on the sphereâ€™s surface. This is done by normalizing the vector from the sphereâ€™s center to the point mass and then scaling it by the sphereâ€™s radius. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Correcting the Position: We then calculate the correction vector from the point massâ€™ last valid position to this tangent point and update the point massâ€™ position by moving it along this correction vector, but scaled down by the factor (1 â€“ f), where f is the friction coefficient. This scaling ensures that the collision response takes friction into account.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				Planes:
				<br>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Detection: We use the planeâ€™s normal and a known point on the plane to compute dot products for both the point massâ€™s (last_position) and its current position. If these dot products have opposite signs or one of them is zero, it means that the point mass has crossed the plane between the last update and the current one.
					</li>
					<li>
						Computing the Intersection: Using the difference in the dot products, we determine a parameter t that tells us how far along the segment from last_position to position the plane was intersected. This gives us the exact intersection (or tangent) point on the plane.
					</li>
					<li>
						Bumping Off the Plane: To prevent numerical issues or the point mass from getting stuck exactly on the plane, we add a small offset (defined by SURFACE_OFFSET) in the direction fo the normal of the intersection point.
					</li>
					<li>
						Correcting the Position: Like the sphere, we then compute the correction vector from the point massâ€™s last position to this adjusted intersection point and update its position using the friction-adjusted correction vector, i.e., by moving it from the last position along the correction vector scaled by (1 â€“ f).
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<br>
			<br>

			<li> 
				Show us screenshots of your shaded cloth from scene/sphere.json in its final resting state on the sphere using the default ks = 5000 as well as with ks = 500 and ks = 50000. Describe the differences in the results.
				<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">

				Comparing the different ks above, we see that the default provide the most realistic simulation of a cloth on the sphere. There is a good amount of wrinkles and sagging as well as tension within the cloth. As
				for the ks = 500, we see that it is very loose and drapey. This is because a lower ks leads to this as the springs are not as stiff and has less tension. Finally, for the ks = 50000, we see that the cloth is more rigid and has less wrinkles. This is because 
				the spring has much higher tension that prevents it from draping.
				<br><br>

			<li>
				Show us a screenshot of your shaded cloth lying peacefully at rest on the plane. If you havenâ€™t by now, feel free to express your colorful creativity with the cloth! (You will need to complete the shaders portion first to show custom colors.)
				<figure>
					<img src="./images/part3_plane.png" style="width:100%"/>
				</figure>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>

		<ol>
			<li> 
				Describe your implementation of handling self-collisions.
				<br>
				<br>
				Instead of looping through every point mass of the cloth and figuring out if they pair-wise collided at every given timestep, we implemented a hash-based approach to decrease the size of point mass subsets that we need to compare point masses to.
				<br>
				<br>
				In each time step, we hash each point mass into different groups based on their position, using bounding boxes. Points that are close together and has the potential to collide will be hashed into the same bucket whilst points far from each other will be hashed into different buckets to save us time from considering them later on.
				<br>
				<br>
				After building a hash table based on the description above, we call the self_collide function on every point mass, which does the following:
				<br>
				<br>
				It calculates a hash based on the point massâ€™s position and retrieves nearby point masses from that bucket. Note that the hash function here is the same as the one that we used to build the hash table in the first place. For each candidate (excluding itself), it checks if the candidate is within a collision threshold (defined as 2 times the clothâ€™s thickness). If so, it computes a correction vector that would push the point mass away from the candidate just enough to resolve the overlap. These correction vectors are accumulated, averaged, and then scaled by the number of simulation steps to ensure smooth adjustments. Finally, the averaged correction is applied to the point massâ€™s position, reducing the overlap and preventing self-collisions.
			</li>
			<br>

			<li> 
				Show us at least 3 screenshots that document how your cloth falls and folds on itself, starting with an early, initial self-collision and ending with the cloth at a more restful state (even if it is still slightly bouncy on the ground).

			<li> 
				Vary the density as well as ks and describe with words and screenshots how they affect the behavior of the cloth as it falls on itself.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
				<br>
				<br>
				A shader program is a collection of instructions that run on the GPU, essentially telling it how to process graphics data. It can be broken down into 2 parts:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Vertex Shader: <br>
						The vertex shader is the starting point. It processes each vertex of a 3D model one by one, transforming vertex positions from model space to world space and to screen space. It also handles other data like normals, texture coordinates, and tangents. This processed data is then passed on to the fragment shader.
					</li>
					<li>
						Fragment Shader: <br>
						The fragment shader computes the final color of every pixel. It takes in the interpolated data from the vertex shader and applies lighting models and other material effects (eg. Blinn-Phong shading, glossy surfaces, etc).
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.
				<br>
				<br>
				The Blinn-Phong shading model breaks down object shading into 3 components, which are ultimately combined/overlayed together:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Ambient: This is a constant light (indirect illumination), giving the object a basic level of brightness even when itâ€™s not directly lit.
					</li>
					<li>
						Diffuse: This calculates how much light hits a surface based on the angle between the light and the surfaceâ€™s normal. It follows Lambertâ€™s cosine law, which means the intensity decreases as the angle between the light direction and the surface normal increases.
					</li>
					<li>
						Specular: We first calculate the halfway vector which is the normalized sum of the light direction and the viewerâ€™s direction.  The closer the surface normal is to this halfway vector, the brighter the specular highlight appears, controlled by a specular exponent that adjusts the sharpness of the highlight.
					</li>
				</ul> 
			</li>
			<li>
				Show a screenshot of your texture mapping shader using your own custom texture by modifying the textures in /textures/.

				Show a screenshot of bump mapping on the cloth and on the sphere. Show a screenshot of displacement mapping on the sphere. Use the same texture for both renders. You can either provide your own texture or use one of the ones in the textures directory, BUT choose one thatâ€™s not the default texture_2.png. Compare the two approaches and resulting renders in your own words. Compare how your the two shaders react to the sphere by changing the sphere meshâ€™s coarseness by using -o 16 -a 16 and then -o 128 -a 128.

				Show a screenshot of your mirror shader on the cloth and on the sphere.
